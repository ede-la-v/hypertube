Welcome to Woodbury.

3
00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:06.131
<i>We're a community.</i>

4
00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.565
<i>Well, that's my wife,
that's my daughter and me.</i>

5
00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.262
Don't hurt my little girl.

6
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:14.600
I want Michonne.

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.393
<i>Turn her over and
all this goes away.</i>

8
00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:18.624
He wants the prison.
<i>He wants us dead.</i>

9
00:00:20.673 --> 00:00:22.463
<i>We should go after them.</i>

10
00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:23.707
We should finish him.

11
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:25.009
What the hell are you doing!?

12
00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.760
- It's not worth it.
- That was a slaughter.

You look like
you barely <i>got out alive.</i>

56
00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:27.864
<i>- Tara.</i>
<i>- I mean...</i>

57
00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.766
We're a little on edge.

58
00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:32.486
We've been holed up in here waiting
for the National Guard since--

59
00:06:32.487 --> 00:06:34.271
- The shit hit the fan.
- Language.

60
00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:37.240
Since the crap hit the fan.

61
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:38.742
Which it did

62
00:06:38.743 --> 00:06:41.344
right before it got flung
all over the damn place.

63
00:06:45.016 --> 00:06:48.218
Are you planning
on staying in the building?

64
00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:54.825
Are you planning on
staying or not?

65
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.129
- Holy shit, with the no talking.
- Tara.

66
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.199
My sister asked you a question.

67
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.201
Just for the night.

68
00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:07.304
You see this?

69
00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:11.508
This here is a fully loaded,
standard issue Smith & Wesson.

70
00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.909
I'm Atlanta City Police

71
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.278
and I have enough artillery
in here to kill you

72
00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.347
every day
for the next 10 years.

73
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.251
You mess with me or my family,

74
00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:23.537
and I swear to Christ,
I will put you down.

75
00:07:23.538 --> 00:07:26.706
Got it?

76
00:07:26.707 --> 00:07:28.792
Got it.

77
00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:31.995
Then we're cool.

78
00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.263
Pound it.

79
00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:40.336
Here, bro.

80
00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:44.340
We'll hold onto this
until you go.

81
00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:46.843
Yeah.

82
00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:57.871
You got a name?

83
00:08:03.694 --> 00:08:05.695
Brian.

84
00:08:08.032 --> 00:08:09.883
Brian Heriot.

85
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.194
You got to be hungry.

86
00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:43.099
You're not gonna find
anything better in there.

87
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.035
Tara ransacked the place

88
00:08:45.036 --> 00:08:47.003
after Miss Wilhelm
took off for Florida.

89
00:08:48.205 --> 00:08:51.474
Big fan of butter beans,
Miss Wilhelm.

90
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:06.756
Thank you.

91
00:09:38.472 --> 00:09:41.290
...four, five.

92
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:45.178
Come on, kiddo.
Show me what you got here.

93
00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:53.153
Everything okay?

94
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.478
She didn't eat, again.

95
00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:05.048
She likes the corned beef.
Try that.

96
00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:06.750
<i>I'm saving the last</i>
<i>two cans for Dad.</i>

97
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.752
She's not picky,
she's terrified.

98
00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:10.754
<i>Shh.</i>

99
00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:22.966
Why don't you slow down,
buddy, all right?

100
00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:24.367
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

101
00:10:24.368 --> 00:10:26.202
Bucket on the left
is for washing,

102
00:10:26.203 --> 00:10:28.438
right is for rinsing.

103
00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:30.440
Tara.

104
00:10:31.609 --> 00:10:33.526
Oh.

105
00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:46.406
Sorry.

106
00:10:47.408 --> 00:10:48.958
You get enough to eat?

107
00:10:52.713 --> 00:10:54.798
I'll get you some coffee.

108
00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:57.584
Sit down.

109
00:10:57.585 --> 00:10:59.385
Right there.
Go on.

110
00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:11.681
Go ahead, roll again.

111
00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:15.685
Hey, come here.

112
00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:17.904
You got a cigarette?

113
00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:19.689
<i>Dad, your oxygen tank.</i>

114
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.242
Do you not see
that red sticker?

115
00:11:22.243 --> 00:11:25.779
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra
Menthol is gonna blow this place up

116
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.397
after all the work we've done
to stay alive up here. Okay?

117
00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:30.399
It's all the same, Lily.

118
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.735
You can stop
that talk right there.

119
00:11:32.736 --> 00:11:34.921
It's just a cigarette.

120
00:11:36.757 --> 00:11:38.758
Help yourself.

121
00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:41.211
We got roni sticks for days.

122
00:11:41.212 --> 00:11:43.346
Years, probably.

123
00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:45.799
You see that big truck
parked outside?

124
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.935
Come on, dude,
the Gorbelli food truck.

125
00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:53.089
Ray Charles could have seen it.

126
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.590
Yeah.

127
00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:56.643
Dad drove for them.

128
00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:58.444
Even with the tank.

129
00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:00.196
The day they closed down
the 75--

130
00:12:00.197 --> 00:12:02.732
When the S-H-I-T
hit the fan.

131
00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:05.952
He grabbed Megan from school,
picked me up at the hospital--

132
00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:08.771
She stole a bunch of oxygen
tanks from that dump.

133
00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:10.874
Then the three of us
rushed over to get Tara.

134
00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.793
I was at the station
working, booking.

135
00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.749
With everything going on,

136
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.837
the attacks, the Army
going into Atlanta,

137
00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:26.339
he wasn't about to let us
out of his sight.

138
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.808
Lucky for us, the old man's
truck was pretty much stocked

139
00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:30.560
<i>floor to ceiling</i>
<i>with sketti rings,</i>

140
00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:34.330
<i>turkey chili,</i>
<i>and these little suckers.</i>

141
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:38.501
Meg, Granddad
needs a break, okay?

142
00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:40.987
- Lily.
- Sure, Daddy.

143
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.660
On three.

144
00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:49.329
A little help here, big guy.

145
00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:52.982
Here.

146
00:12:52.983 --> 00:12:55.084
Oh, right.
No, not you.

147
00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:56.870
The other big guy in the room.

148
00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:59.822
Tara.

149
00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:01.991
Okay.

150
00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:03.593
On three.

151
00:13:03.594 --> 00:13:06.045
Okay, one, two--

152
00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:19.025
Here. Here.

153
00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:26.883
<i>Hey. You hear them?</i>

154
00:13:26.884 --> 00:13:28.651
Yeah.

155
00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:31.120
Yeah.

156
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.907
Get my legs, friend?

157
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.878
Tara's been up there
a bunch of times

158
00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:41.197
blasting them bastards
to pieces.

159
00:13:41.198 --> 00:13:45.134
She says they just
keep getting back up.

160
00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:48.338
I told her no more.

161
00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.974
Can't afford to waste
her bullets.

162
00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:57.546
You got kids?

163
00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:01.067
No.

164
00:14:01.068 --> 00:14:03.386
When my girls were born,

165
00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:06.739
that's when I finally figured
out what it was to be a man.

166
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.025
You know, a real man.

167
00:14:10.744 --> 00:14:13.162
You protect them,
you keep them safe.

168
00:14:13.163 --> 00:14:14.781
You just try
to make them stronger

169
00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:17.450
until they can
look out for themselves.

170
00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:20.169
But this here,

171
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.273
I-- I never counted
on this.

172
00:14:26.377 --> 00:14:28.177
Hey, I got a buddy.

173
00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:30.413
Bill Jenkins,
he lives up in 303.

174
00:14:30.414 --> 00:14:33.850
He's got a real nice
backgammon set up there.

175
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:36.135
He won't mind and he keeps
it under his bed there.

176
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:39.605
Just... please.

177
00:14:39.606 --> 00:14:41.391
You've been out there
in the world

178
00:14:41.392 --> 00:14:44.927
and you know how to handle
yourself around those things.

179
00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:46.946
Look, I know you might
not understand it

180
00:14:46.947 --> 00:14:48.982
'cause you don't got
a baby girl of your own,

181
00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:50.817
<i>but...</i>

182
00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:55.238
it might be something that might
make my Megan talk again.

183
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.607
<i>Please.</i>

184
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:32.278
Thank you.

185
00:17:34.248 --> 00:17:35.749
You're welcome.

186
00:18:43.517 --> 00:18:45.518
Couple things for the road.

187
00:18:46.854 --> 00:18:49.122
I'm okay.

188
00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:51.357
You helped us.

189
00:18:51.358 --> 00:18:53.493
We're saying thank you.

190
00:18:53.494 --> 00:18:55.245
Deal with it.

191
00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.918
I guess you'll be
needing this back.

192
00:19:04.421 --> 00:19:05.922
Keep it.

193
00:19:07.308 --> 00:19:09.709
Don't...

194
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.761
throw that at me.

195
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:16.933
It's your gun.
You can have it back.

196
00:19:16.934 --> 00:19:19.736
You need another one.

197
00:19:19.737 --> 00:19:21.271
I have this.

198
00:19:25.109 --> 00:19:26.659
Tara was right.

199
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.244
We should have frisked you.

200
00:19:28.245 --> 00:19:30.947
I found it upstairs.

201
00:19:32.566 --> 00:19:34.617
You keep that.

202
00:19:41.008 --> 00:19:43.576
You have to kill the brain.

203
00:19:43.577 --> 00:19:45.128
What?

204
00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:47.964
Your sister, she shot
'em in the body,

205
00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:50.683
but you have to hit 'em here.

206
00:19:50.684 --> 00:19:53.102
That's what kills them.

207
00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:54.437
Why?

208
00:20:00.528 --> 00:20:02.812
I need to ask you something.

209
00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:08.318
My dad's got stage four
lung cancer.

210
00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:10.820
I worked oncology
for a few years.

211
00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:13.623
He's nearing the end.

212
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:19.329
He's got about
two days of oxygen.

213
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.830
Maybe less.

214
00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:25.251
We never thought
he'd make it this long.

215
00:20:25.252 --> 00:20:28.788
You've already done
so much for us, but...

216
00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:32.475
there's an old folks home

217
00:20:32.476 --> 00:20:34.677
a couple of blocks from here.

218
00:20:34.678 --> 00:20:38.898
Even one tank
would mean everything.

219
00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:41.801
He's the only one who can
put a smile on Megan's face.

220
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.471
Even for a second.

221
00:24:04.263 --> 00:24:07.198
- They're both full.
- Are you okay?

222
00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:08.700
Yeah.

223
00:24:28.504 --> 00:24:30.505
You didn't let me
say thank you.

224
00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:32.757
Yeah, I'm okay.

225
00:24:32.758 --> 00:24:34.459
Sit.

226
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.315
Let me be a nurse again.

227
00:24:54.697 --> 00:24:58.416
Good news is it doesn't look
like you need any stitches.

228
00:24:59.752 --> 00:25:01.319
Bad news...

229
00:25:03.122 --> 00:25:05.623
this is gonna sting like
a couple of angry bees.

230
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.185
Feels good to have
something to do.

231
00:25:17.186 --> 00:25:20.972
Nobody ever mentioned just how boring
the end of the world was gonna be.

232
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:48.533
She thought you were her dad.

233
00:25:48.534 --> 00:25:50.034
Megan.

234
00:25:51.703 --> 00:25:53.922
When she saw you
out there on the street.

235
00:25:56.175 --> 00:25:59.477
He went out one night about
three and a half years ago

236
00:25:59.478 --> 00:26:01.896
to get a couple beers
and a Powerball ticket.

237
00:26:01.897 --> 00:26:03.898
Said he'd be right back.

238
00:26:06.685 --> 00:26:09.104
Megan thought you were him,

239
00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:12.490
finally coming right back.

240
00:26:16.362 --> 00:26:18.530
<i>- Mama.</i>
<i>- In here, honey.</i>

241
00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:23.501
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

242
00:26:25.421 --> 00:26:28.957
Brian just got a boo-boo that
needs a little cleaning up.

243
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:30.925
Same as when you get a cut.

244
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.018
I don't have the ointment.

245
00:26:44.523 --> 00:26:47.559
Why don't you watch
my patient until I get back?

246
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.227
Okay.

247
00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.825
What happened to your eye?

248
00:27:03.826 --> 00:27:05.376
It's gone.

249
00:27:07.129 --> 00:27:09.164
Something happen to you

250
00:27:09.165 --> 00:27:10.948
or were you just
born like that?

251
00:27:10.949 --> 00:27:12.783
Something happened to me.

252
00:27:15.504 --> 00:27:18.256
Was that bad to ask?

253
00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:25.230
No.

254
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:32.353
I'll tell you what
happened to my eye,

255
00:27:32.354 --> 00:27:34.606
but you have to promise
to keep it secret.

256
00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:38.493
I promise.

257
00:27:40.996 --> 00:27:42.831
What's that?

258
00:27:42.832 --> 00:27:44.332
Pinkie swear.

259
00:27:52.258 --> 00:27:55.510
Plus cross my heart
and hope to die.

260
00:27:59.014 --> 00:28:00.882
Well...

261
00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:04.435
I'm a pirate.

262
00:28:04.436 --> 00:28:06.337
No way.

263
00:28:13.011 --> 00:28:14.812
Yeah, you caught me.

264
00:28:18.284 --> 00:28:21.402
What really happened was
I was trying to help someone.

265
00:28:22.988 --> 00:28:25.290
Someone I loved very much.

266
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:27.575
How were you trying
to help them?

267
00:28:29.295 --> 00:28:32.497
I was trying to protect
them, you know?

268
00:28:32.498 --> 00:28:35.333
Stop them getting hurt.

269
00:28:35.334 --> 00:28:37.201
But you got hurt instead.

270
00:28:37.202 --> 00:28:39.036
Yeah.

271
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.675
Did they get hurt, too?

272
00:28:43.676 --> 00:28:45.843
Uh...

273
00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:47.762
yeah, yeah, they did.

274
00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:52.784
I'm sorry.

275
00:28:56.021 --> 00:28:57.889
Me, too.

276
00:29:03.136 --> 00:29:05.053
What is it?

277
00:29:05.054 --> 00:29:06.722
Chess.

278
00:29:06.723 --> 00:29:08.557
Looks hard.

279
00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:12.961
Well, maybe for some folks,
but you're smart.

280
00:29:12.962 --> 00:29:14.479
You'll catch on quick.

281
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.297
What's this one called?

282
00:29:16.298 --> 00:29:18.483
That's a pawn.

283
00:29:18.484 --> 00:29:20.852
They're your soldiers.

284
00:29:22.605 --> 00:29:24.606
Do they die?

285
00:29:24.607 --> 00:29:26.808
Sometimes.

286
00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:29.194
Do you lose if they die?

287
00:29:29.195 --> 00:29:31.413
No, not necessarily.

288
00:29:32.415 --> 00:29:34.082
You can lose a lot of soldiers,

289
00:29:34.083 --> 00:29:36.535
but still win the game.

290
00:29:40.673 --> 00:29:42.791
That's the king.

291
00:29:44.343 --> 00:29:46.678
That's the guy
you want to capture.

292
00:29:56.689 --> 00:29:59.107
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

293
00:30:06.783 --> 00:30:08.700
Looks like you.

294
00:30:11.854 --> 00:30:13.905
Yeah.

295
00:30:21.664 --> 00:30:23.582
Come on, let's play.

296
00:30:26.002 --> 00:30:29.037
So these ones are pawns.

297
00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:25.277
He's gone.

298
00:31:25.278 --> 00:31:28.647
I think he's been gone a while.

299
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:35.287
Y'all should go now.

300
00:31:35.288 --> 00:31:37.572
Just give us a minute.

301
00:31:39.608 --> 00:31:41.877
I love you, Daddy.

302
00:31:47.967 --> 00:31:49.801
<i>Tara!</i>

303
00:31:52.221 --> 00:31:54.389
<i>- Stop! What are you doing?</i>
<i>- It's not Dad!</i>

304
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.790
- Stop!
- It's not Dad!

305
00:33:16.606 --> 00:33:20.141
I know, okay?

306
00:33:20.142 --> 00:33:23.078
It happens no matter what?

307
00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:24.713
Yeah.

308
00:33:26.415 --> 00:33:28.283
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

309
00:33:31.187 --> 00:33:33.088
He could have got me.

310
00:33:35.057 --> 00:33:36.758
He almost got me.

311
00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:43.131
<i>I was thinking</i>

312
00:33:43.132 --> 00:33:46.200
he would have been grateful
<i>or whatever</i>

313
00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:49.087
that you stopped him,
from him--

314
00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:51.389
you know what I mean?

315
00:33:58.931 --> 00:34:00.932
So, yeah, we're cool.

316
00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:38.046
Good-bye.

317
00:35:38.047 --> 00:35:40.031
No.

318
00:35:40.032 --> 00:35:41.833
- We're coming with you.
- No.

319
00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:43.334
There has to be
someplace better,

320
00:35:43.335 --> 00:35:44.836
and you're gonna
help us find it.

321
00:35:44.837 --> 00:35:46.538
- Lily.
- I saw the picture, Brian.

322
00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:49.657
You had a family, I know that.

323
00:35:49.658 --> 00:35:52.177
And I know we're not them.

324
00:35:52.178 --> 00:35:54.179
But for now,
you're stuck with us.

325
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.098
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.
- I can't.

326
00:35:57.099 --> 00:35:59.551
You already have.

327
00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:09.903
<i>Where should we go?</i>

328
00:36:09.904 --> 00:36:12.072
No use making a plan.

329
00:36:12.073 --> 00:36:13.940
We'll go where they let us.

330
00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:16.076
<i>Who's they?</i>

331
00:36:16.077 --> 00:36:18.295
The roads.

332
00:36:18.296 --> 00:36:20.163
The biters.

333
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.469
I'm not really a cop.

334
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.338
I mean, it's not a total lie.

335
00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:29.890
I was in the academy.

336
00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:34.811
I'm sorry I lied to you.

337
00:36:37.598 --> 00:36:39.850
You don't have to be sorry.

338
00:36:39.851 --> 00:36:41.935
<i>Well, I am.</i>

339
00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:46.440
<i>Do you think we can make it?</i>

340
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.745
We'll make it.

341
00:36:53.197 --> 00:36:55.749
Are you lying to me?

342
00:36:58.953 --> 00:37:00.871
No.

343
00:37:22.276 --> 00:37:24.845
You can come join us, Megan.

344
00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:33.737
It's just gonna take some time.

345
00:37:34.855 --> 00:37:37.023
It's okay.

346
00:39:13.638 --> 00:39:15.138
We'll find another car soon.

347
00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.007
I hope you're right.

348
00:39:17.008 --> 00:39:19.843
This whole country backdrop
is reminding me of Sam.

349
00:39:19.844 --> 00:39:22.896
- Here we go.
- I thought she was the one.

350
00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:25.632
Then you went camping,
ate mushrooms, game over.

351
00:39:25.633 --> 00:39:28.852
You're forgetting the part where Sam broke
down and told me she had a boyfriend,

352
00:39:28.853 --> 00:39:30.537
that she wasn't
really into chicks.

353
00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:33.239
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

354
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.742
<i>Tara.</i>

355
00:39:35.743 --> 00:39:37.661
Oh, man.
Damn it!

356
00:39:37.662 --> 00:39:39.946
- <i>You all right?</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

357
00:39:39.947 --> 00:39:42.749
- Tara, stop. Let me look at it.
- I'm fine!

358
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.669
Just hand me my backpack.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

359
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.710
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

360
00:39:57.598 --> 00:39:59.265
I'm fine.
Let's go.

361
00:40:06.691 --> 00:40:10.176
Drop your bags.
Let's go. Come on.

362
00:40:11.345 --> 00:40:13.029
- Megan.
- Megan, come on.

363
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.748
<i>Megan, right now.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

364
00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:17.033
- <i>Megan!</i>
<i>- Come on, Megan.</i>

365
00:40:17.034 --> 00:40:18.985
Megan, come on.

366
00:40:18.986 --> 00:40:20.954
Megan, right now.
Come on.

367
00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:29.462
Come on, Megan.
Come on.

368
00:40:29.463 --> 00:40:31.331
<i>Megan!</i>

369
00:40:35.553 --> 00:40:37.170
<i>Here.</i>

370
00:40:41.559 --> 00:40:44.144
Go.

371
00:40:44.145 --> 00:40:46.012
Move.

372
00:41:14.074 --> 00:41:15.909
Ah!

373
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.745
- Brian!
- I'm here.

374
00:42:04.892 --> 00:42:07.393
I'm sorry.
You okay?

375
00:42:07.394 --> 00:42:10.180
You all right?

376
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:12.482
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

377
00:42:12.483 --> 00:42:14.567
Okay?

378
00:42:20.775 --> 00:42:24.077
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

379
00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:29.866
Holy shit.

380
00:42:33.788 --> 00:42:35.789
Cross my heart.
